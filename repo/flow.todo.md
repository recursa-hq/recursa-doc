I dont think the implementation met spec

=== DONE

before asking next AI developer to finish the todo blueprint ,

need blueprint for ;

1. proper openroute cheatsheet based on npm readme
2. dedicated retry mechanism

- now do the blueprint for those. again. blueprint concept is to save your token cost , do not write complete code per todo, only cheatsheet with // TODO: comments , method name, params, return type. all for the next AI developer to implement.

=== DONE

before asking next AI developer to finish the todo blueprint ,

need blueprint for ;

1. dedicated multi-level logging.
2. comprehensive test cases.

- now do the blueprint for those. again. blueprint concept is to save your token cost , do not write complete code per todo, only cheatsheet with // TODO: comments , method name, params, return type. all for the next AI developer to implement.

=== DONE

before asking next AI developer to finish the todo blueprint , lets once again make sure the todo blueprint producing radical DRYness codebase

again. blueprint concept is to save your token cost , do not write complete code per todo, only cheatsheet with // TODO: comments, method name, params, return type. all for the next AI developer to implement.

=== DONE

before asking next AI developer to finish the todo blueprint , lets once again understand everything in docs , then make sure the current todo blueprint is enough for producing plan that met expectations in docs, not by hardcoding complete working code, but by "cheatsheet-ing" .

again. blueprint concept is to save your token cost , do not write complete code per todo, only cheatsheet with method name, params, return type. all for the next AI developer to implement.

=== DONE

understand everything in docs, then initialize the project by prepare detailed boilerplate across structure. each files should contain only concise // TODO: comments, type signatures, and detailed import statements to serve as a "cheatsheet" for the next AI developer.

again. to save your token cost , do not write complete code per todo, only cheatsheet like method name, params, return type.

all should HOF no OOP
