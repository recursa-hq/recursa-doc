=== DOING

understand everything in docs, then initialize the project by prepare detailed boilerplate across structure. each files should contain only concise // TODO: comments, type signatures, and detailed import statements to serve as a "cheatsheet" for the next AI developer.

again. to save your token cost , do not write complete code per todo, only cheatsheet like method name, params, return type.

all should HOF no OOP

make sure the work is enough to produce production ready blueprint
